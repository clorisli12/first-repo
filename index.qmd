## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
ggplot(data = storms, mapping = aes(x = pressure, y = wind)) +
  geom_point(color = 'purple',
             alpha = 0.3, shape = 16) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', color = 'purple', se = FALSE)

      
       



```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
